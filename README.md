# Fun Request #1

> (!) For this request, you will build a site using `html`, `css`, and `javascript`. To learn more about the rules of this request, please go to the `Q&A` section.

## Theme & Description

You will create a webpage (a site with one page) with the theme of your **favorite color**. 

This webpage must include:
1. A hero (view example below).
2. Your favorite color.
3. A pseudo-navegation bar.
4. An about section with at least one short paragraph.

## What is a hero?
<img src="https://images.prismic.io/prismic-main/ZyGeK68jQArT0Aes_Notion.gif?auto=format,compress" alt="example of a hero" title="hero" width=500 height=250>

A `hero` is a section of a webpage that is usually `75vh` to `100vh` with a title and a one-sentence description of a product. In the example above, we have the Notion's website's hero.

## Q&A (PLEASE READ!)

### How do I submit the project?
Fork the repository. You don't need to do anything fancy.

### Use of a JS Framework & Library 
I know some of you guys know React, Svelete, Next, and other frameworks/libraries, but please DO NOT use these. Use raw `html`, `css`, and `javascript`.

### Can I use multiple pages?
If you do it right 😉. You may only have one `html` file.

### What files may I use?
Only `.htm`/`.html`, `.css`, and `.js` filetypes are allowed. A more complete breakdown is seen here:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td span="col">Filetype</td>
      <td span="col">MaxQuantity Allowed</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td span="row"><code>.htm</code>/<code>.html</code></td>
      <td><b>1</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td span="row"><code>.css</code></td>
      <td><b>1</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td span="row"><code>.js</code></td>
      <td><b>1</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td span="row"><code>.png</code>/<code>.jpeg</code>/<code>.jpg</code></td>
      <td><b>3</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td span="row"><code>.otf</code>/<code>.ttf</code></td>
      <td><b>5</b></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### If I know tools like `Sass` and/or `TypeScript`, can I use them?
No. Please refer back to `What files may I use?`

### May I use the `copy link` feature to copy images onto my website?
No. Please **download** the image and place in the `images` folder. Refer to the image in the `src` as so. 

`<img src="images/<file-name>" alt="<alt-text>">`

### If I want to use custom fonts what do I do?
Download the font(s) as `.otf` or/and `.ttf` files. Make a custom `fonts` folder. Refer to the fonts in your CSS or HTML that way.
